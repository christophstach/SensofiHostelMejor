            <h2>No man, I don't eat pork</h2>
            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
              world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
              know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
              made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
              other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

            <h2>Hold on to your butts</h2>
            <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
              I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case,
              it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to
              hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

            <h2>I'm serious as a heart attack</h2>
            <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
              know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
              times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of
              the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>
